// #JAVA code
// AI Activation button [this instance is set for every interseciton ID]
// all stated are in red initally [Get list of the traffic light in that intersection] 
// assign for each lane the number of cars from TrafficPicGenrator.py  
// start loop {Create seesionManager and new instance for every intersection SessionManger[trafficIntersection intersection , List<TrafficLight> trafficLightListq]}
	// Genrate a image and pass it to the YOLO model 
	// pass this data in the Q-learning function model -> new trafficlight state
	// assign the data in the DB + track the wait time for each intersection for the next switch
// loop back
